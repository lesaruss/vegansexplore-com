# Supabase Edge Function sources

Git-tracked sources for the Supabase Edge Functions behind this site, per the
LESARUSS repo standard (all code to GitHub). Deploying is a separate step: the
running version lives in Supabase project `fwbhwfxpncrsfhttimna` and is
deployed with the Supabase CLI or the Supabase MCP tools, not by pushing here.

Vercel serves this repository root directly, so a `redirects` entry in
`vercel.json` sends `/supabase/*` to `/`. These files are never served.

## ve-auth

Vegans Explore identity and membership API. `verify_jwt` is **false** by
design: the site calls it with the anon key in the Authorization header and
the VE app JWT in `body.token`, and the function does its own verification.
Keep that setting on any redeploy.

Staged and not yet deployed as of 2026-09-09:

- `resolveLaunchedCommunity` normalization. A trailing state or country
  qualifier and a trailing "City" are stripped before the chapter lookup, so
  "New York City" resolves to the launched `new-york` chapter instead of
  reading as a brand new city. Live evidence for the bug: a
  `ve_chapter_requests` row with `community_slug` `new-york-city`, created
  2026-09-09 08:36 UTC. The user-facing path is already fixed in
  `guide.html` (`normalizeCityEntry`), which normalizes before calling
  `city_status` / `join_city`; this change moves the same guarantee behind
  the API so any other caller gets it too.
- `VE_TENANT_ID` on both signup inserts. Both paths hardcoded the LESARUSS
  tenant, so every Vegans Explore registrant was written as a LESARUSS
  identity (error_registry `MEMBERS-TABLE-TENANT-HARDCODED-VE`). The database
  already enforces the correct value via the `trg_stamp_ve_tenant_on_insert`
  trigger, so this change is a no-op once deployed and the two cannot
  disagree.
